The foundation of Ruby on Rails is the Request-Response Cycle - the process of asking for, and receiving, a website to be delivered to your browser.

First, our browser makes a request to the server. The server is what talks to our Rails application.

Second, in our Rails application, the route takes the request and finds the right Controller and method to handle the request.

Third, the Controller gets the relevant data and passes it on the View.

Finally, the View nicely packages the information and sends it back to our browser to see.

In the Request-Response Cycle, we learned that when a user makes a request in the browser, the route handles that request and passes it to the right Controller.

Weâ€™ll start building our app by making a Controller called Pages. Controllers decide what information our application needs through methods. Our Pages Controller will be in charge of decisions for the home page of the Etsy app.

How do we generate a Controller?

If we want to generate a Controller called Pages, we enter the following in the terminal:

rails generate controller Pages
Notice that Controller names are always plural.
